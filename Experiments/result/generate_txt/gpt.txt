an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000 - 0000 - 0000 - 0000 - 000000000000 )

# discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user. badge _ counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter ( via / filter / create ) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non - expiring. an application can safely " bake in " any filters that are created, it is not necessary ( or advisable ) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. filters allow applications to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually concerned

the amazon resource names (arns) of the iam managed policies that you want to use as a managed session policy. the policies must exist in the same account as the iam user that is requesting federated access. you must pass an inline or managed session policy to this operation. you can pass a single json policy document to use as an inline session policy. you can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. the plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. you can provide up to 10 managed policy arns. for more information about arns, see amazon resource names (arns) and amazon web services service namespaces in the amazon web services general reference. this parameter is optional. however, if you do not pass any session policies, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. when you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the iam user policies and the session policies that you pass. this gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. you cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the iam user. for more information, see session policies in the iam user guide. the resulting credentials can be used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. if that policy specifically references the federated user session in the principal element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. these permissions are granted in addition to the permissions that are granted by the session policies. an amazon web services conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. the packedpolicysize response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit

# discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user. badge _ counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter ( via / filter / create ) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non - expiring. an application can safely " bake in " any filters that are created, it is not necessary ( or advisable ) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. filters allow applications to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually concerned

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000 - 0000 - 0000 - 0000 - 000000000000 )

# discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user. badge _ counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter ( via / filter / create ) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non - expiring. an application can safely " bake in " any filters that are created, it is not necessary ( or advisable ) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. filters allow applications to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually concerned

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000 - 0000 - 0000 - 0000 - 000000000000 )

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000 - 0000 - 0000 - 0000 - 000000000000 )

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000 - 0000 - 0000 - 0000 - 000000000000 )

# discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user. badge _ counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter ( via / filter / create ) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non - expiring. an application can safely " bake in " any filters that are created, it is not necessary ( or advisable ) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. filters allow applications to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually concerned

the url that contains a signature version 4 signed request for the copydbclustersnapshot api action in the amazon web services region that contains the source db cluster snapshot to copy. the presignedurl parameter must be used when copying an encrypted db cluster snapshot from another amazon web services region. don't specify presignedurl when you are copying an encrypted db cluster snapshot in the same amazon web services region. the pre-signed url must be a valid request for the copydbclustersnapshot api action that can be executed in the source amazon web services region that contains the encrypted db cluster snapshot to be copied. the pre-signed url request must contain the following parameter values: kmskeyid - the amazon web services kms key identifier for the customer master key (cmk) to use to encrypt the copy of the db cluster snapshot in the destination amazon web services region. this is the same identifier for both the copydbclustersnapshot action that is called in the destination amazon web services region, and the action contained in the pre-signed url. destinationregion - the name of the amazon web services region that the db cluster snapshot is to be created in. sourcedbclustersnapshotidentifier - the db cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted db cluster snapshot to be copied. this identifier must be in the amazon resource name (arn) format for the source amazon web services region. for example, if you are copying an encrypted db cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 amazon web services region, then your sourcedbclustersnapshotidentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115. to learn how to generate a signature version 4 signed request, see authenticating requests: using query parameters (amazon web services signature version 4) and signature version 4 signing process. if you are using an amazon web services sdk tool or the cli, you can specify sourceregion (or --source-region for the cli) instead of specifying presignedurl manually. specifying sourceregion autogenerates a pre-signed url that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source amazon web services region. if you supply a value for this operation's sourceregion parameter, a pre-signed url will be calculated on your behalf

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000 - 0000 - 0000 - 0000 - 000000000000 )
