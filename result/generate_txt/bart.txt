an optional filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you're willing to wait for the requested field to complete. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

#discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non-expiring. an applications can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. the filter supports applications that wish to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually creating, the api can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the api returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x api family). #safety filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. any string returned as a result of an api call with a safe filter will be inline-able into html without script-injection concerns. that is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, html tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. applications that are using unsafe filters will be encouraged to create an unsafe filter. all filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections. note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though urlencode(...). many fields can and will contain html in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields)

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to filter compute engine instances, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you are willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering computeengine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `=*` comparison can be applied to substrings to match input with `:*` labels. for more information about string fields, see filtering in the amazon ec2 user guide

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with thesame request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000 -0000-000000000000)

name of resource group
a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to filter your list results, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you are willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `*` comparison is used to test whether a key has been defined. for more information about filtering, see filtering in the amazon ec2 user guide

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

#discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable, non-expiring, and the motivation for creating filters are: - all: all fields will be processed

an odata filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use a regular expression, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you are willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the ` :*` comparison can also be used to test whether a key has been defined. for instance, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for more information, see filtering on nested fields for filtering

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

the maximum number of results per page that should be returned. if the number of available results is larger than `maxresults`, compute engine returns a `nextpagetoken` that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. acceptable values are `0` to `500`, inclusive. (default: `500`)

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with thesame request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000 -0000-0000-000000000000)

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

the continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. if the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 resourceexpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. this field is not supported when watch is true. clients may start a watch from the last resourceversion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

the continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. if the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server the server will respond with a 410 resourceexpired error indicating the client must restart their list without the continue field. this field is not supported when watch is true. clients may start a watch from the last resourceversion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters reservation details listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to filter for subset of fields, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you are willing to wait for the requested field to complete. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the ` :*` comparison can also be used to test whether a key has been defined. for instance, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for more information about filtering, see filtering.automaticrestart = false`

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

specifies a page token to use. set `pagetoken` to the `nextpagetoken` returned by a previous list request to get the next page of results
limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

optional. a request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000 -0000-000000000000)

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to filter your list results, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you are willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `=*` comparison can be performed to test whether a key has been defined. for example: ``` you can also filter nested fields. for instance, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate `and` expression within parentheses

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

an odata filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use a regular expression, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you are willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `=*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example: to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for instance, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for more information, see filtering on nested expressions

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to filter compute engine instances, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you are willing to wait for the requested operation to complete. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering computeengine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `*` comparison is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. to filter on nested fields, provide each separate `name` in parentheses. for example: ``` you can specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering based on resource labels.to filter on multiple instances of a resource, provide the `eq` operator against all fields

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with thesame request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000 -0000-0000-000000000000)

etag
limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue fields are empty, clients may assume that no more results will be available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned
