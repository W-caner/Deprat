a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

filter items by property values
a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

the version of the api. this parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'. service fabric rest api version is based on the runtime version in which the api was introduced or was changed. service fabric runtime supports more than one version of the api. this is the latest supported version of the api. if a lower api version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification. additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. so if the latest api version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that api. however the behavior of the api will be as per the documented 6.0 version

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

version of the api to be used with the client request. current version is 2017-04-02
the version of the api. this parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'. service fabric rest api version is based on the runtime version in which the api was introduced or was changed. service fabric runtime supports more than one version of the api. this is the latest supported version of the api. if a lower api version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification. additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. so if the latest api version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that api. however the behavior of the api will be as per the documented 6.0 version

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

field by which to sort the list
a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either =, !=, >, = or :. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named example-instance by specifying name != example-instance. the : operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the = operator. the :* comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with owner label use:  labels.owner:*  you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify scheduling.automaticrestart = false to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example:  (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake")  by default, each expression is an and expression. however, you can include and and or expressions explicitly. for example:  (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true)  if you want to use a regular expression, use the eq (equal) or ne (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: fieldname eq unquoted literal fieldname eq

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)
