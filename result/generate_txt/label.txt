limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

#discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non-expiring. an application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. filters allow applications to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the api can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the api returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x api family). #safety filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. any string returned as a result of an api call with a safe filter will be inline-able into html without script-injection concerns. that is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, html tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. all filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections. note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though urlencode(...). many fields can and will contain html in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields). when using unsafe filters, the api returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. this means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation. #built in filters the following filters are built in: default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total #compatibility with v1.x for ease of transition from earlier api versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. these are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in v2.0. new applications should not use these filters

filter items by property values
a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

the amazon resource names (arns) of the iam managed policies that you want to use as a managed session policy. the policies must exist in the same account as the iam user that is requesting federated access. you must pass an inline or managed session policy to this operation. you can pass a single json policy document to use as an inline session policy. you can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. the plaintext that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. you can provide up to 10 managed policy arns. for more information about arns, see amazon resource names (arns) and amazon web services service namespaces in the amazon web services general reference. this parameter is optional. however, if you do not pass any session policies, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. when you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the iam user policies and the session policies that you pass. this gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. you cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the iam user. for more information, see session policies in the iam user guide. the resulting credentials can be used to access a resource that has a resource-based policy. if that policy specifically references the federated user session in the principal element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. these permissions are granted in addition to the permissions that are granted by the session policies. an amazon web services conversion compresses the passed session policies and session tags into a packed binary format that has a separate limit. your request can fail for this limit even if your plaintext meets the other requirements. the packedpolicysize response element indicates by percentage how close the policies and tags for your request are to the upper size limit

#discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non-expiring. an application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. filters allow applications to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the api can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the api returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x api family). #safety filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. any string returned as a result of an api call with a safe filter will be inline-able into html without script-injection concerns. that is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, html tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. all filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections. note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though urlencode(...). many fields can and will contain html in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields). when using unsafe filters, the api returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. this means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation. #built in filters the following filters are built in: default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total #compatibility with v1.x for ease of transition from earlier api versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. these are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in v2.0. new applications should not use these filters

allows filtering of the partitions health state objects returned in the result of service health query based on their health state. the possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states. only partitions that match the filter are returned. all partitions are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. if not specified, all entries are returned. the state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these value obtained using bitwise 'or' operator. for example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of partitions with healthstate value of ok (2) and warning (4) will be returned. - default - default value. matches any healthstate. the value is zero. - none - filter that doesn't match any healthstate value. used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. the value is 1. - ok - filter that matches input with healthstate value ok. the value is 2. - warning - filter that matches input with healthstate value warning. the value is 4. - error - filter that matches input with healthstate value error. the value is 8. - all - filter that matches input with any healthstate value. the value is 65535

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

sorts list results by a certain order. by default, results are returned in alphanumerical order based on the resource name. you can also sort results in descending order based on the creation timestamp using `orderby="creationtimestamp desc"`. this sorts results based on the `creationtimestamp` field in reverse chronological order (newest result first). use this to sort resources like operations so that the newest operation is returned first. currently, only sorting by `name` or `creationtimestamp desc` is supported

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

the version of the api. this parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'. service fabric rest api version is based on the runtime version in which the api was introduced or was changed. service fabric runtime supports more than one version of the api. this is the latest supported version of the api. if a lower api version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification. additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. so if the latest api version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that api. however the behavior of the api will be as per the documented 6.0 version

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

#discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non-expiring. an application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. filters allow applications to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the api can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the api returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x api family). #safety filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. any string returned as a result of an api call with a safe filter will be inline-able into html without script-injection concerns. that is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, html tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. all filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections. note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though urlencode(...). many fields can and will contain html in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields). when using unsafe filters, the api returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. this means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation. #built in filters the following filters are built in: default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total #compatibility with v1.x for ease of transition from earlier api versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. these are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in v2.0. new applications should not use these filters

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

filter images for adult content. the following are the possible filter values. off: may return images with adult content. if the request is through the image search api, the response includes thumbnail images that are clear (non-fuzzy). however, if the request is through the web search api, the response includes thumbnail images that are pixelated (fuzzy). moderate: if the request is through the image search api, the response doesn't include images with adult content. if the request is through the web search api, the response may include images with adult content (the thumbnail images are pixelated (fuzzy)). strict: do not return images with adult content. the default is moderate. if the request comes from a market that bing's adult policy requires that safesearch is set to strict, bing ignores the safesearch value and uses strict. if you use the site: query operator, there is the chance that the response may contain adult content regardless of what the safesearch query parameter is set to. use site: only if you are aware of the content on the site and your scenario supports the possibility of adult content

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

the version of the api. this parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'. service fabric rest api version is based on the runtime version in which the api was introduced or was changed. service fabric runtime supports more than one version of the api. this is the latest supported version of the api. if a lower api version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification. additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. so if the latest api version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that api. however the behavior of the api will be as per the documented 6.0 version

a flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. a health report is sent to a service fabric gateway application, which forwards to the health store. if immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from http gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the http gateway application is using. this is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the http gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the gateway. if immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the http gateway. therefore, it will be batched according to the healthreportsendinterval configuration. this is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. by default, reports are not sent immediately

a prefix used to filter returned repositories. only repositories with names that start with repositoryprefix are returned
an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

the version of the api. this parameter is required and its value must be '6.4'. service fabric rest api version is based on the runtime version in which the api was introduced or was changed. service fabric runtime supports more than one version of the api. this version is the latest supported version of the api. if a lower api version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification. additionally the runtime accepts any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. so if the latest api version is 6.0 and the runtime is 6.1, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that api. however the behavior of the api will be as per the documented 6.0 version

the version of the api. this parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'. service fabric rest api version is based on the runtime version in which the api was introduced or was changed. service fabric runtime supports more than one version of the api. this is the latest supported version of the api. if a lower api version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification. additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. so if the latest api version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that api. however the behavior of the api will be as per the documented 6.0 version
optional. specify a specific number of audio channels to encode to, e.g. 2
a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

this field is used to specify the number of records to skip in the result set before returning the first payment dispute in the paginated response. a zero-based index is used, so if you set the offset value to 0 (default value), the first payment dispute in the result set appears at the top of the response. combine offset with the limit parameter to control the payment disputes returned in the response. for example, if you supply an offset value of 0 and a limit value of 10, the response will contain the first 10 payment disputes from the result set that matches the input criteria. if you supply an offset value of 10 and a limit value of 20, the response will contain payment disputes 11-30 from the result set that matches the input criteria. min: 0; max: total number of payment disputes - 1; default: 0

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

#discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non-expiring. an application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. filters allow applications to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the api can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the api returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x api family). #safety filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. any string returned as a result of an api call with a safe filter will be inline-able into html without script-injection concerns. that is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, html tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. all filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections. note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though urlencode(...). many fields can and will contain html in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields). when using unsafe filters, the api returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. this means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation. #built in filters the following filters are built in: default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total #compatibility with v1.x for ease of transition from earlier api versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. these are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in v2.0. new applications should not use these filters

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

the version of the api. this parameter is required and its value must be '6.2'. service fabric rest api version is based on the runtime version in which the api was introduced or was changed. service fabric runtime supports more than one version of the api. this version is the latest supported version of the api. if a lower api version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification. additionally the runtime accepts any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. so if the latest api version is 6.0 and the runtime is 6.1, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that api. however the behavior of the api will be as per the documented 6.0 version

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

#discussion the stack exchange api allows applications to exclude almost every field returned. for example, if an application did not care about a user's badge counts it could exclude user.badge_counts whenever it calls a method that returns users. an application excludes fields by creating a filter (via /filter/create) and passing it to a method in the filter parameter. filters are immutable and non-expiring. an application can safely "bake in" any filters that are created, it is not necessary (or advisable) to create filters at runtime. the motivation for filters are several fold. filters allow applications to reduce api responses to just the fields they are concerned with, saving bandwidth. with the list of fields an application is actually concerned with, the api can avoid unneccessary queries thereby decreasing response time (and reducing load on our infrastructure). finally, filters allow us to be more conservative in what the api returns by default without a proliferation of parameters (as was seen with body, answers, and comments in the 1.x api family). #safety filters also carry a notion of safety, which is defined as follows. any string returned as a result of an api call with a safe filter will be inline-able into html without script-injection concerns. that is to say, no additional sanitizing (encoding, html tag stripping, etc.) will be necessary on returned strings. applications that wish to handle sanitizing themselves should create an unsafe filter. all filters are safe by default, under the assumption that double-encoding bugs are more desirable than script injections. note that this does not mean that "safe" filter is mearly an "unsafe" one with all fields passed though urlencode(...). many fields can and will contain html in all filter types (most notably, the *.body fields). when using unsafe filters, the api returns the highest fidelity data it can reasonably access for the given request. this means that in cases where the "safe" data is the only accessible data it will be returned even in "unsafe" filters. notably the *.body fields are unchanged, as they are stored in that form. fields that are unchanged between safe and unsafe filters are denoted in their types documentation. #built in filters the following filters are built in: default, each type documents which fields are returned under the default filter (for example, answers). withbody, which is default plus the *.body fields none, which is empty total, which includes just .total #compatibility with v1.x for ease of transition from earlier api versions, the filters _b, _ba, _bc, _bca, _a, _ac, and _c are also built in. these are unsafe, and exclude a combination of question and answer body, comments, and answers so as to mimic the body, answers, and comments parameters that have been removed in v2.0. new applications should not use these filters

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

the url that contains a signature version 4 signed request for the copydbclustersnapshot api action in the amazon web services region that contains the source db cluster snapshot to copy. the presignedurl parameter must be used when copying an encrypted db cluster snapshot from another amazon web services region. don't specify presignedurl when you are copying an encrypted db cluster snapshot in the same amazon web services region. the pre-signed url must be a valid request for the copydbclustersnapshot api action that can be executed in the source amazon web services region that contains the encrypted db cluster snapshot to be copied. the pre-signed url request must contain the following parameter values: kmskeyid - the amazon web services kms key identifier for the customer master key (cmk) to use to encrypt the copy of the db cluster snapshot in the destination amazon web services region. this is the same identifier for both the copydbclustersnapshot action that is called in the destination amazon web services region, and the action contained in the pre-signed url. destinationregion - the name of the amazon web services region that the db cluster snapshot is to be created in. sourcedbclustersnapshotidentifier - the db cluster snapshot identifier for the encrypted db cluster snapshot to be copied. this identifier must be in the amazon resource name (arn) format for the source amazon web services region. for example, if you are copying an encrypted db cluster snapshot from the us-west-2 amazon web services region, then your sourcedbclustersnapshotidentifier looks like the following example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:cluster-snapshot:aurora-cluster1-snapshot-20161115. to learn how to generate a signature version 4 signed request, see authenticating requests: using query parameters (amazon web services signature version 4) and signature version 4 signing process. if you are using an amazon web services sdk tool or the cli, you can specify sourceregion (or --source-region for the cli) instead of specifying presignedurl manually. specifying sourceregion autogenerates a pre-signed url that is a valid request for the operation that can be executed in the source amazon web services region. if you supply a value for this operation's sourceregion parameter, a pre-signed url will be calculated on your behalf

the category id is used to limit the results. this field can have one category id or a comma separated list of ids. for example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?category_ids=29792 note: currently, you can pass in only one category id per request. you can also use any combination of the category_ids, epid, and q fields. this gives you additional control over the result set. for example, let's say you are looking of a toy phone. if you search for "phone", the result set will be mobile phones because this is the "best match" for this search. but if you also include the toy category id, the results will be what you wanted. for example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q=phone&category_ids=220 the list of ebay category ids is not published and category ids are not the same across all the ebay marketplaces. you can use the following techniques to find a category by site: use the category changes page. use the taxonomy api. for details see get categories for buy apis. submit the following method to get the dominantcategoryid for an item. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q= keyword&fieldgroups=aspect_refinements note: if a top-level (l1) category is specified, you must also include the q query parameter. required: the method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

the version of the api. this parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'. service fabric rest api version is based on the runtime version in which the api was introduced or was changed. service fabric runtime supports more than one version of the api. this is the latest supported version of the api. if a lower api version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification. additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. so if the latest api version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that api. however the behavior of the api will be as per the documented 6.0 version

number to skip
an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

an optional request id to identify requests. specify a unique request id so that if you must retry your request, the server will know to ignore the request if it has already been completed. for example, consider a situation where you make an initial request and the request times out. if you make the request again with the same request id, the server can check if original operation with the same request id was received, and if so, will ignore the second request. this prevents clients from accidentally creating duplicate commitments. the request id must be a valid uuid with the exception that zero uuid is not supported ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000)

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

the set of opt in feature flags which cause breaking changes to responses. while rocket apis look to avoid breaking changes under the active major version, the formats of responses may need to evolve over this time. these feature flags allow clients to select which response formats they expect and avoid breaking clients as these formats evolve under the current major version. ### flags - `all` - enable all flags. useful for testing. _don't use in production_. - `idp` - dynamic item detail pages with schedulable rows. - `ldp` - dynamic list detail pages with schedulable rows. - `hb` - hubble formatted image urls. - `rpt` - updated resume point threshold logic. - `cas` - "custom asset search", inlcude `customassets` in search results. - `lrl` - do not pre-populate related list if more than `max_list_prefetch` down the page. - `cd` - custom destination support. see the `feature-flags.md` for available flag details

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

text to search for in the trivia
restricts stores returned to those matching a filter. the following syntax is available: * a string field value can be written as text inside quotation marks, for example `"query text"`. the only valid relational operation for text fields is equality (`=`), where text is searched within the field, rather than having the field be equal to the text. for example, `"comment = great"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * a number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. the valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (``, `>=`). note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. you can prepend the `not` operator to an expression to negate it. * a date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. fields with date and time use the rfc3339 time format. leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. the valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (``, `>=`). note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. you can prepend the `not` operator to an expression to negate it. * multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `and` or `or` operators between the expressions. if a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it's just another part of the character string to be matched. you can prepend the `not` operator to an expression to negate it. only filtering on labels is supported, for example `labels.key=value`

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

the version of the api. this parameter is required and its value must be '6.0'. service fabric rest api version is based on the runtime version in which the api was introduced or was changed. service fabric runtime supports more than one version of the api. this is the latest supported version of the api. if a lower api version is passed, the returned response may be different from the one documented in this specification. additionally the runtime accept any version that is higher than the latest supported version up to the current version of the runtime. so if the latest api version is 6.0, but if the runtime is 6.1, in order to make it easier to write the clients, the runtime will accept version 6.1 for that api. however the behavior of the api will be as per the documented 6.0 version

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`
indicates whether every visible scope for each scope type (zone, region, global) should be included in the response. for new resource types added after this field, the flag has no effect as new resource types will always include every visible scope for each scope type in response. for resource types which predate this field, if this flag is omitted or false, only scopes of the scope types where the resource type is expected to be found will be included

specifies which fields in the response should be expanded
a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

the continue option should be set when retrieving more results from the server. since this value is server defined, clients may only use the continue value from a previous query result with identical query parameters (except for the value of continue) and the server may reject a continue value it does not recognize. if the specified continue value is no longer valid whether due to expiration (generally five to fifteen minutes) or a configuration change on the server, the server will respond with a 410 resourceexpired error together with a continue token. if the client needs a consistent list, it must restart their list without the continue field. otherwise, the client may send another list request with the token received with the 410 error, the server will respond with a list starting from the next key, but from the latest snapshot, which is inconsistent from the previous list results - objects that are created, modified, or deleted after the first list request will be included in the response, as long as their keys are after the "next key". this field is not supported when watch is true. clients may start a watch from the last resourceversion value returned by the server and not miss any modifications

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

the iam permissions boundary policy to simulate. the permissions boundary sets the maximum permissions that the entity can have. you can input only one permissions boundary when you pass a policy to this operation. an iam entity can only have one permissions boundary in effect at a time. for example, if a permissions boundary is attached to an entity and you pass in a different permissions boundary policy using this parameter, then the new permissions boundary policy is used for the simulation. for more information about permissions boundaries, see permissions boundaries for iam entities in the iam user guide. the policy input is specified as a string containing the complete, valid json text of a permissions boundary policy. the maximum length of the policy document that you can pass in this operation, including whitespace, is listed below. to view the maximum character counts of a managed policy with no whitespaces, see iam and sts character quotas. the regex pattern used to validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following: any printable ascii character ranging from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ascii character range the printable characters in the basic latin and latin-1 supplement character set (through \u00ff) the special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000a), and carriage return (\u000d)

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned

allows filtering of the deployed service package health state objects returned in the result of deployed application health query based on their health state. the possible values for this parameter include integer value of one of the following health states. only deployed service packages that match the filter are returned. all deployed service packages are used to evaluate the aggregated health state of the deployed application. if not specified, all entries are returned. the state values are flag-based enumeration, so the value can be a combination of these values, obtained using the bitwise 'or' operator. for example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of service packages with healthstate value of ok (2) and warning (4) are returned. - default - default value. matches any healthstate. the value is zero. - none - filter that doesn't match any healthstate value. used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. the value is 1. - ok - filter that matches input with healthstate value ok. the value is 2. - warning - filter that matches input with healthstate value warning. the value is 4. - error - filter that matches input with healthstate value error. the value is 8. - all - filter that matches input with any healthstate value. the value is 65535

a flag that indicates whether the report should be sent immediately. a health report is sent to a service fabric gateway application, which forwards to the health store. if immediate is set to true, the report is sent immediately from http gateway to the health store, regardless of the fabric client settings that the http gateway application is using. this is useful for critical reports that should be sent as soon as possible. depending on timing and other conditions, sending the report may still fail, for example if the http gateway is closed or the message doesn't reach the gateway. if immediate is set to false, the report is sent based on the health client settings from the http gateway. therefore, it will be batched according to the healthreportsendinterval configuration. this is the recommended setting because it allows the health client to optimize health reporting messages to health store as well as health report processing. by default, reports are not sent immediately

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

a filter expression that filters resources listed in the response. most compute resources support two types of filter expressions: expressions that support regular expressions and expressions that follow api improvement proposal aip-160. if you want to use aip-160, your expression must specify the field name, an operator, and the value that you want to use for filtering. the value must be a string, a number, or a boolean. the operator must be either `=`, `!=`, `>`, `=` or `:`. for example, if you are filtering compute engine instances, you can exclude instances named `example-instance` by specifying `name != example-instance`. the `:` operator can be used with string fields to match substrings. for non-string fields it is equivalent to the `=` operator. the `:*` comparison can be used to test whether a key has been defined. for example, to find all objects with `owner` label use: ``` labels.owner:* ``` you can also filter nested fields. for example, you could specify `scheduling.automaticrestart = false` to include instances only if they are not scheduled for automatic restarts. you can use filtering on nested fields to filter based on resource labels. to filter on multiple expressions, provide each separate expression within parentheses. for example: ``` (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") ``` by default, each expression is an `and` expression. however, you can include `and` and `or` expressions explicitly. for example: ``` (cpuplatform = "intel skylake") or (cpuplatform = "intel broadwell") and (scheduling.automaticrestart = true) ``` if you want to use a regular expression, use the `eq` (equal) or `ne` (not equal) operator against a single un-parenthesized expression with or without quotes or against multiple parenthesized expressions. examples: `fieldname eq unquoted literal` `fieldname eq 'single quoted literal'` `fieldname eq "double quoted literal"` `(fieldname1 eq literal) (fieldname2 ne "literal")` the literal value is interpreted as a regular expression using google re2 library syntax. the literal value must match the entire field. for example, to filter for instances that do not end with name "instance", you would use `name ne .*instance`

azure storage events allow applications to receive notifications when files change. when azure storage events are enabled, a file changed event is raised. this event has a property indicating whether this is the final change to distinguish the difference between an intermediate flush to a file stream and the final close of a file stream. the close query parameter is valid only when the action is "flush" and change notifications are enabled. if the value of close is "true" and the flush operation completes successfully, the service raises a file change notification with a property indicating that this is the final update (the file stream has been closed). if "false" a change notification is raised indicating the file has changed. the default is false. this query parameter is set to true by the hadoop abfs driver to indicate that the file stream has been closed."

limit is a maximum number of responses to return for a list call. if more items exist, the server will set the `continue` field on the list metadata to a value that can be used with the same initial query to retrieve the next set of results. setting a limit may return fewer than the requested amount of items (up to zero items) in the event all requested objects are filtered out and clients should only use the presence of the continue field to determine whether more results are available. servers may choose not to support the limit argument and will return all of the available results. if limit is specified and the continue field is empty, clients may assume that no more results are available. this field is not supported if watch is true. the server guarantees that the objects returned when using continue will be identical to issuing a single list call without a limit - that is, no objects created, modified, or deleted after the first request is issued will be included in any subsequent continued requests. this is sometimes referred to as a consistent snapshot, and ensures that a client that is using limit to receive smaller chunks of a very large result can ensure they see all possible objects. if objects are updated during a chunked list the version of the object that was present at the time the first list result was calculated is returned
